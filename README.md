👋 Hi, I'm Knell!  

I'm a Software Developer based in Germany 🇩🇪.  I'm passionate about automation - saving time, ensuring reproducibility, and making sure things run smoothly (even if seeing my old code sometimes makes me cringe a bit 😅). 

I believe in keeping things simple and automating everything that can be automated! ⚙️

**Here's a bit more about me:**

*   **Technologies:** 💻 Python, Bash/Shell Scripting, Ansible, Terraform, Docker/Podman, Kubernetes.  Familiar with Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, ...) and Git.
*   **Environment:** 🌳  MacOS for development, Linux for running things. Owning a homelab setup with OpnSense, TrueNAS Scale, and Proxmox, where I run everything from a Pi-hole to my own DevOps stack with GitLab and full SSO authentication.
*   **Culture/Work:** 🤝 I enjoy working both independently and as part of a team. I appreciate a good Agile workflow and believe in the power of well-done Scrum.
*   **Personal:** 🎉 Outside of coding, you can find me tinkering with my homelab, gaming, or battling weeds in my garden 🌱. 

**Fun Fact:**  "I once automated all the boring tasks in my life - then I woke up for work" 😴
